Vulkan Capture for OBS
======================

This is a plugin for OBS Studio that allows Vulkan/OpenGL applications to be captured. For instructions on how to use, see [this page](https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture#usage).

For this plugin to work you also need the corresponding tools to start the application with. These tools are available [on Flathub as `org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.OBSVkCapture`](https://github.com/flathub/org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.OBSVkCapture).
